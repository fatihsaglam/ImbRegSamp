  abstract = 	 {The problem of imbalanced domains, framed within predictive tasks, is relevant in many practical applications. When dealing with imbalanced domains a performance degradation is usually observed on the most rare and relevant cases for the user. This problem has been thoroughly studied within a classification setting where the target variable is nominal. The exploration of this problem in other contexts is more recent within the research community. For regression tasks, where the target variable is continuous, only a few solutions exist. Pre-processing strategies are among the most successful proposals for tackling this problem. In this paper we propose a new pre-processing approach for dealing with imbalanced regression. Our algorithm, SMOGN, incorporates two existing proposals trying to solve problems detected in both of them. We show that SMOGN has advantages in comparison to other approaches. We also show that our method has a different impact on the learners used, displaying more advantages for Random Forest and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines learners.}

  abstract="Several real world prediction problems involve forecasting rare values of a target variable. When this variable is nominal we have a problem of class imbalance that was already studied thoroughly within machine learning. For regression tasks, where the target variable is continuous, few works exist addressing this type of problem. Still, important application areas involve forecasting rare extreme values of a continuous target variable. This paper describes a contribution to this type of tasks. Namely, we propose to address such tasks by sampling approaches. These approaches change the distribution of the given training data set to decrease the problem of imbalance between the rare target cases and the most frequent ones. We present a modification of the well-known Smote algorithm that allows its use on these regression tasks. In an extensive set of experiments we provide empirical evidence for the superiority of our proposals for these particular regression tasks. The proposed SmoteR method can be used with any existing regression algorithm turning it into a general tool for addressing problems of forecasting rare extreme values of a continuous target variable.",

  abstract = 	 {The problem of imbalanced domains, framed within predictive tasks, is relevant in many practical applications. When dealing with imbalanced domains a performance degradation is usually observed on the most rare and relevant cases for the user. This problem has been thoroughly studied within a classification setting where the target variable is nominal. The exploration of this problem in other contexts is more recent within the research community. For regression tasks, where the target variable is continuous, only a few solutions exist. Pre-processing strategies are among the most successful proposals for tackling this problem. In this paper we propose a new pre-processing approach for dealing with imbalanced regression. Our algorithm, SMOGN, incorporates two existing proposals trying to solve problems detected in both of them. We show that SMOGN has advantages in comparison to other approaches. We also show that our method has a different impact on the learners used, displaying more advantages for Random Forest and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines learners.}

  abstract="Several real world prediction problems involve forecasting rare values of a target variable. When this variable is nominal we have a problem of class imbalance that was already studied thoroughly within machine learning. For regression tasks, where the target variable is continuous, few works exist addressing this type of problem. Still, important application areas involve forecasting rare extreme values of a continuous target variable. This paper describes a contribution to this type of tasks. Namely, we propose to address such tasks by sampling approaches. These approaches change the distribution of the given training data set to decrease the problem of imbalance between the rare target cases and the most frequent ones. We present a modification of the well-known Smote algorithm that allows its use on these regression tasks. In an extensive set of experiments we provide empirical evidence for the superiority of our proposals for these particular regression tasks. The proposed SmoteR method can be used with any existing regression algorithm turning it into a general tool for addressing problems of forecasting rare extreme values of a continuous target variable.",

  abstract = {Imbalanced domains are an important problem frequently arising in real world predictive analytics. A significant body of research has addressed imbalanced distributions in classification tasks, where the target variable is nominal. In the context of regression tasks, where the target variable is continuous, imbalanced distributions of the target variable also raise several challenges to learning algorithms. Imbalanced domains are characterized by: (1) a higher relevance being assigned to the performance on a subset of the target variable values; and (2) these most relevant values being underrepresented on the available data set. Recently, some proposals were made to address the problem of imbalanced distributions in regression. Still, this remains a scarcely explored issue with few existing solutions. This paper describes three new approaches for tackling the problem of imbalanced distributions in regression tasks. We propose the adaptation to regression tasks of random over-sampling and introduction of Gaussian Noise, and we present a new method called WEighted Relevance-based Combination Strategy (WERCS). An extensive set of experiments provides empirical evidence of the advantage of using the proposed strategies and, in particular, the WERCS  method. We analyze the impact of different data characteristics in the performance of the methods. A data repository with 15 imbalanced regression data sets is also provided to the research community.}

  abstract = {Learning from imbalanced data sets is known to be a challenging task. There are many proposals to tackle the challenge for classification problems, but regarding regression the solutions are few. In the context of regression, imbalanced learning means that there is a concern with the accurate prediction of the target values in a subset of the continuous target variable, considering that these values rarely occur in the data set. In this article, we extend the G-SMOTE algorithm that is used in classification to regression tasks. G-SMOTE is a pre-processing algorithm that differs from the SMOTE algorithm as it allows the generation of synthetic instances in a geometric region around the selected instances rather than in the line segment that joins the two selected instances. The performance of G-SMOTE for regression was compared against other methods, and the empirical results show that our proposal outperformed those methods.}

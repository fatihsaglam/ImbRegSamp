# ImbRegSamp
Sampling methods for imbalanced regression. Implemented resampling methods are:

1- SMOTER

2- SMOGN

Implemented metrics are:

1- WSSE (weighted sum of squared error)

2- WMSE (weighted mean squared error)

3- WMAD (weighted mean absolute deviation)

4- WMAPE (weighted mean absolute percentage error)

Implemented relevance functions are:

1- PCHIP (Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomials)

2- Inverse Kernel Density Estimation

More methods will be added.
